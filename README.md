# Sass-and-Compass-Uncomplicated-CSS
Final work of the Sass and Compass course, of Alura's Front-end training. 
Used for automation and performance. 

I learned things like: 
The most used preprocessor in the world. 
Use variables in CSS code. 
Easy-to-maintain CSS with super powers. 
Extend the CSS and avoid repetition.
